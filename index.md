# About me

I'm a linguist from Denmark who completed my PhD at the University of Newcastle in Australia. Using a variety of field methods I research spatial language, culture, and cognition in the Indigenous language Wik-Mungkan. I completed my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Copenhagen in Functional and Cognitive Linguistics.

My primary research interests are within the fields of anthropological linguistics, cognitive science, and semantic typology.
