# About me

I'm a field linguist from Denmark who study Indigenous Australian and Mesoamerican languages. 

My primary research interests are within the fields of anthropological linguistics, cognitive science, and semantic typology, with a strong focus on spatial language.

I completed my PhD at the University of Newcastle (Australia) and my masterâ€™s degree at the University of Copenhagen in Functional and Cognitive Linguistics.
