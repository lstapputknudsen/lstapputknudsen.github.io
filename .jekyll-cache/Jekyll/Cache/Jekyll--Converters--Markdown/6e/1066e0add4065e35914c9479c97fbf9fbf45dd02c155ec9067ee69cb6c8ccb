<h3 id="phd">PhD</h3>

<p>Understanding the complex interplay between the physical landscape, culture, cognition, and language is at the heart of my PhD, that is part of the ARC funded <a href="ozspace.org">OzSpace Project</a>. My thesis is an in-depth study of spatial language and spatial practices in the Anindilyakwa speaking community on Groote Eylandt. In collaboration with the <a href="https://www.anindilyakwa.org.au/">Anindilyakwa Language Centre</a>, I‚Äôm investigating how space is communicated about and conceptualised in an Aboriginal community based on an island.</p>

<h3 id="linguistic-fieldwork">Linguistic fieldwork</h3>

<p>Apart from my fieldwork based PhD, I‚Äôve been doing linguistic fieldwork since 2017. I‚Äôve worked on documenting spatial language in Nahuatl as spoken in Tequila (Veracruz), Zojualo (San Luis Potosi) and Hueyapan (Morellos) and I‚Äôve also worked on documenting reciprocal constructions and spatial language in Acazulco Otom√≠ (The state of Mexico).</p>

<p>I am particularly interested in how technology can effectively be combined with traditional methods of language documentation and how making this technology easily accessible can help both experts and non-experts with efforts of language documentation.</p>

<h3 id="psycholinguistics">Psycholinguistics</h3>

<p>Experimental design and using psycholinguistics methods both in the field and in the lab is integral to my research and my interests in cognitive science. I‚Äôve used and been involved in developing a range of psycholinguistic methods designed to be used in the field, with a focus on methods targeting motion descriptions and spatial gestures. For example my acting skills can be seen on full display in the brilliant <a href="link">Associated Motion Video Stimuli</a> designed by Ditte Boeg Thomsen and Mads Nielsen.</p>

<p>For my <a href="link">master‚Äôs thesis</a> I designed a mouse tracking study investigating the processing of reflexive pronouns in Danish as part of my master‚Äôs thesis. I also participate in the <a href="link">Lab of Applied Language Science</a> at the University of Newcastle developing interactive eye-tracking tasks.</p>

<h3 id="semantic-typology">Semantic typology</h3>

<p>Underlying my research is an interest in semantic typology, or the study of how meaning is structured across the worlds languages. This is relevant to my work on <a href="link">reciprocal constructions</a> (Danish article, English in prep.), spatial frames of reference (in Nahuatl and as part of my PhD), and I‚Äôve written a <a href="link">pioneering paper</a> (in Danish) on how the domain of baked goods is structured differently across a handful of European languages.</p>
